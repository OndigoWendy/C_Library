Q&A
Q What is the lowest-level language in the computer world?
A The computer’s machine language is the lowest because the machine language,
made up of 0s and 1s, is the only language that the computer can understand
directly.

Q What are the advantages of high-level programming languages?
A Readability, maintainability, and portability are the main advantages of high-level
programming languages.

Q What is C, anyway?
A C is a general-purpose programming language. It’s a high-level language that has
advantages such as readability, maintainability, and portability. Also, C allows you
to get down to the hardware level to increase the performance speed if needed. A C
compiler is needed to translate programs written in C into machine-understandable
code. The portability of C is realized by recompiling the C programs with different
C compilers intended for different types of computers.

Q Can I learn C in a short time?
A Yes. C is a small programming language. There are not many C keywords or com-
mands to remember. Also, it’s very easy to read and write C programs because C is
a high-level programming language that is close to human languages, especially
English. You can learn C in a relatively short time.
