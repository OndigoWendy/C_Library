 Concepts and statements about the C language:
• Some header files should be included at the beginning of your C program.

• Header files, such as stdio.h and stdlib.h, contain the declarations for functions
used in your C program; for example, the printf() and exit() functions.

• Comments in your C programs are needed to help you in documenting your pro-
grams. You can put comments anywhere you like in your programs.

• In ANSI C, a comment starts with the opening comment mark, /*, and ends with
the closing comment mark, */.

• Every C program must have one but only one main() function. The program exe-
cution starts and ends with the main() function.

• The return statement can be used to return a value to indicate to the operating sys-
tem whether an error has occurred. The exit() function terminates a program; the

argument to the function indicates the error status, too.

• Compiling and linking are consecutive steps that have to be finished before an exe-
cutable file is produced.

• Everybody, including you and me, makes mistakes in programming. Debugging is
a very important step in your program design and coding.
