Q&A
Q Why do you need to put comments into your programs?
A Comments help you document what a program does. Especially when a program
becomes very complex, you need to write comments to explain different parts in
the program.
Q Why is the main() function needed in a program?
A The execution of a C program starts and ends with the main() function. Without
the main() function, the computer does not know where to start to run a program.
Q What does the #include directive do?
A The #include directive is used to include header files that contain the declarations
to the functions used in your C program. In other words, the #include directive
tells the C preprocessor to look into the include path to find the specified header
file.
Q Why do you need a linker?
A After compiling, some function code may still be missing in the object file of a
program. A linker must then be used to link the object file to the C standard library
or other user-generated libraries and include the missing function code so that an
executable file can be created.
