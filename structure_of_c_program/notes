Summary of Concepts and operators:
• A constant in C is a value that never changes. A variable, on the other hand, can
present different values.
• A combination of constants, variables, and operators is called an expression in the
C language. An expression is used to denote different computations.
• The arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
• A statement consists of a complete expression suffixed with a semicolon.

• The C compiler treats a statement block as a single statement, although the state-
ment block might contain more than one statement.

• The function type specified in the declaration of a function determines the type of
the value returned by the function.
• You have to follow certain rules to make a valid function name.

• An argument contains information that you want to pass to a function. An argu-
ment list contains two or more arguments that are separated by commas.

• The opening brace ({) and closing brace (}) are used to mark the start and end of a
C function.
• A function body contains variable declarations and statements.
• Usually, a function should accomplish just one task.
